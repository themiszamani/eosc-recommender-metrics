## Dependencies

1. Install CondaÂ from [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html). Tested on conda v 4.10.3.
2. Run from terminal: `conda env create -f environment.yml`
3. Run from terminal: `conda activate rsmetrics`
4. Run from terminal: `chmod +x ./preprocessor.py ./preprocessor_common.py ./rsmetrics.py`

## Usage

5. Configure `./preprocessor_common.py`, `./preprocessor.py` and `./rsmetrics.py` by editting the `config.yaml` or providing another with `-c`.
6. Run from terminal: `./preprocessor_common.py` in order to gather `users` and `resources` and store them in the `Datastore`:
```bash
./preprocessor_common.py # this will ingest users and resources [from scratch] by retrieving the data from 'cyfronet' provider (which is specified in the config file
./preprocessor_common.py -p cyfronet # equivalent to first one
./preprocessor_common.py -p cyfronet --use-cache # equivalent to first one but use the cache file to read resources instead of downloading them via the EOSC Marketplace
./preprocessor_common.py -p athena # currently is not working since users collection only exist in 'cyfronet'
```
7. Run from terminal: `./preprocessor.py -p <provider>` in order to gather `user_actions` and `recommendations` from the particular provider and store them in the `Datastore`:
```bash
./preprocessor.py # this will ingest user_actions and recommendations [from scratch] by retrieving the data from 'cyfronet' provider (which is specified in the config file
./preprocessor.py -p cyfronet # equivalent to first one
./preprocessor.py -p athena # same procedure as the first one but for 'athena' provider
```
9. Run from terminal: `./rsmetrics.py -p <provider>` in order to gather the respective data (`users`, `resources`, `user_actions` and `recommendations`), calculate `statistics` and `metrics` and store them in the `Datastore`, concerning that particular provider:
```bash
./rsmetrics.py # this will calculate and store statistics and metrics concerning data (users, resources, user_actions and recommendations) concerning the specified provider (which by default is 'cyfronet')
./rsmetrics.py -p cyfronet # equivalent to first one
./rsmetrics.py -p athena # same procedure as the first one for 'athena' provider
```

### Reporting

The reporting script generates an evalutation report in html format automatically served from a spawed localserver [default: localhost:8080](htpp://localhost:8080)
and automatically opens the default browser to present the report.

To execute the script issue:
```
chmod u+X ./report.py
report.py
```
The script will automatically look for evaulation result files in the default folder `./data` and will output the report in the default folder: `./report`

#### Additional script usage with parameters

The `report.py` script can be used with the `--input` parameter: a path to a folder that the results from the evaluation process have been generated (default folder:`./data`). The report script can also take an `--output` parameter: a path to an output folder where the generated report will be served automatically.

_Note:_ the script copies to the output folder all the necessary files such as `pre_metrics.json`, `metrics.json` as well as `report.html.prototype` renamed to `index.html`

```
usage: report.py [-h] [-i STRING] [-o STRING] [-a STRING] [-p STRING]

Generate report

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i STRING, --input STRING
                        Input folder
  -o STRING, --output STRING
                        Output report folder
  -a STRING, --address STRING
                        Address to bind and serve the report
  -p STRING, --port STRING
                        Port to bind and serve the report
```

### Utilities

#### Get service catalog script (./get_service_catalog.py)

This script contacts EOSC Marketplace catalog and generates a csv with a list of all available services, their name, id and url

To execute the script issue:
```
chmod u+x ./get_service_catalog.py
./get_service_catalog.py
```

##### Serve Evaluation Reports as a Service

The `webservice` folder hosts a simple webservice implemented in Flask framework which can be used to host the report results.

__Note__: Please make sure you work in a virtual environment and you have already downloaded the required dependencies by issuing
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The webservice application serves two endpoints
 - `/` : This is the frontend webpage that displays the Report Results in a UI
 - `/api` : This api call returns the evaluation metrics in json format

To run the webservice issue:
```
cd ./webservice
flask run
```

The webservice by default runs in localhost:5000 you can override this by issuing for example:
```
flask run -h 127.0.0.1 -p 8080
```

There is an env variable `RS_EVAL_METRIC_SOURCE` which directs the webservice to the generated `metrics.json` file produced after the evaluation process.
This by default honors this repo's folder structure and directs to the root `/data/metrics.json` path

You can override this by editing the `.env` file inside the `/webservice` folder, or specificy the `RS_EVAL_METRIC_SOURCE` variable accordingly before executing the `flask run` command

_Tested with python 3.9_
